## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/tomato414941/discord-aibotchat.git](https://github.com/tomato414941/discord-aibotchat.git)
   cd discord-aibotchat
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file and add the following content:**

   ```bash
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

   * Replace `your_discord_bot_token` with your actual Discord Bot Token.
   * Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. **Run the bot:**

   ```bash
   python bot/bot.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Using the `/ask` slash command:**
   * `/ask message:<your_message>` - Ask the AI a question without considering conversation history.

2. **Mentioning the bot:**
   * Simply mention the bot followed by your message, e.g., `@AI Bot Chat Hello, how are you?` The bot will consider the conversation history in the channel.

**Examples:**

```
/ask message:What's the weather like today?
@AI Bot Chat Tell me a joke about programming
```

**Note:** When you mention the bot or use the `/ask` command, you'll see a "typing" indicator while the AI generates its response.
